# some context

i've been very interested in an edtech company that builds microschools and i know in order to convince them that i'm able to offer value, i need to show that i understand their stack and can work with it. they actually reached out to me during the summer after i submitted my resume but i didn't have a project aligned with their tech stack so i was not accepted. however, i really wanted to convince them that i could do it so i rushed in 2 days to build a project using all the stack without actually understanding why. i think it's hard to learn something deeply if you're in an aritificial rush that you're running out of time so you just build, use AI, and pray that it would work. but the thing is, you do have enough time. you just need to calm down a little bit and think from first principles. this post is my attempt to understand the why and how company's tech stack and practice by building a project using it.
