dear friends,

the past few days have taught me something very important: you cannot pour from an empty cup. i know this wisdom is not something new, but it takes some hands-on experience to actually internalize it. in a nutshell, here is what happened and what i did that has significantly improved my mindset:

**i ran a pop-up lunch business with my friend**: the process from ideation to execution was really fast. we came up with the idea over a home-cooked dinner, experimented with ways to improve the dish the next day, bought the ingredients a few days after, and took orders/delivered them in the next week. it was fun but it was intense. we encountered many logistical challenges, like finding no containers for the sauce, the address for delivery was too far away, i had an event i was obliged to go to during the day, etc. but we had no time to complain but to find the solutions for each of the problems we faced: reusing old containers, took an uber even tho it costed more than our initial budget, and woke up at around 6 am to cook and finish everything before i left. i still remember i woke up at 6:30 and rushed to the bus stop in 10 mins while praying i got there on time. all of this showed me how i am more capable of execution and overcoming discomfort than i thought i was. my cup was poured with a new source of evidence that allows me to believe in myself more.

**i’ve been very invested in my work**: at school, i’ve been working with my professor and teammates to build a new data team, and i loveeee my job so so much. i am very lucky to have a great manager (also my professor) who cares about my success and makes sure that i am happy with what i chose to work on. i’m also lucky to have great teammates who keep me accountable and celebrate my wins. i really enjoy reading, refactoring, developing, and documenting code. i learned that if i put enough attention and care into it, i can understand the systems and be able to implement improvements or new ideas. my cup was then again poured with new evidence that allows me to be confident in my ability to collaborate with others and work on technical projects.

**i’ve spent a lot of time on my capstone and passion projects**: even though at first i thought i was interested in so many different things, i realized things are very interconnected, and i should listen to my genuine excitement and curiosity instead of others’ opinions. and so, i spent time working on my interactive tutorial that teaches curious beginners reinforcement learning in games, reimplementing micro-interactions on the web, improving my data structures and algorithms skills, and writing more high-performant code. along the way, i’ve also discovered cool and creative things, such as using math to create art and JavaScript to make music! i’ve learned that there is a multitude of self that i hold dear to my heart and they are not necessarily mutually exclusive: 1) one who is dreamy, creative, and loves creating beautiful things and 2) one who is grounded and loves making things more optimized and faster. I also learned how much I enjoy delving into the details and sharing what I’ve learned with others. all of this reminds me of who i am and what kind of work environment i want to be in.

**i trust in my ability to assess the vibes and find people who bring out the best in me**: i love to be surrounded by people who are unapologetically excited about themselves, their interests, and other people, those who love to play and experiment, and sometimes, a bit spontaneous. I used to be insecure if I didn’t have a large social circle, but now i have realized that having 1-2 great friends is enough. somehow, when i’m not trying to make friends and i’m okay being by myself, i’ve attracted people aligned with my values and my vibe :)

i started this semester with an empty cup and was frantically trying to get a job because i was so scared of being broke lol :) but i got exhausted and demotivated very quickly because I didn’t know what values i was able to offer, what i could bring to the table, what I enjoyed working on, and who i wanted to work with. this means i applied from a desperate and one-sided position instead of from a more mutual and confident one. this also affected how i present myself. when my cup is gradually full, i see a positive shift. i now approach job search from a healthier perspective. i still need to grind but now i know i am capable, and i know that when an opportunity comes, i will approach it as finding a long-term teammate/partner who wants both of us to win and bring out the best in each other instead of finding a place just to earn money.

so, friends, next time if you are stuck or feeling like what you’re doing is leading nowhere or just makes you more exhausted, maybe it’s a sign that you need to fill your cup with more aligned values, energy, experiences and people. sometimes, taking a step back is the best thing you can do for yourself.

sincerely,

thu
