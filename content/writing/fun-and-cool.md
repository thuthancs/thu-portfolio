dear friends,

i had this conversation with a friend that i admire and appreciate. we were talking about building projects that are fun and creative. there was a detail where my friend mentioned that she found doing user interviews boring while observing users interacting with the product itself interesting. but i found both interesting AND necessary. we had another conversation where she mentioned another friend of ours who stopped doing something because some part of the process was tedious. we've had quite a few conversations like that. over time, i realized she has her own definitions of "fun," "creative," and "cool"—ones i don't always share.

these conversations made me realize how easy it is to be influenced by people who you deem are smarter or better than you. you subconsciously adopt their definitions as true. it's also easy to build things that impress others rather than something that you are genuinely interested in. but sometimes it's hard because you still need to build things that people want in case you're doing a business or startup. regardless of the situation, i'm practicing forming my own opinions and definitions of things. i'm also practicing not judging other people's interests.

some people enjoy going deep into the lowest level of details, finding joy in the technicality, the craft of mastering a concept or skill. i find this in those who do low-level programming and coding in general. some love optimizing and automating a process that makes their lives and others' easier. some prefer to stay in the abstraction and high-level surface of things, solving problems that humans face and reasoning from first principles. i find this in those who love developing products or doing things that are more user-facing. some people define fun as doing things that are playful, a bit silly, and outside of the box. and some find themselves in a state of flow while sitting for hours working on a "boring" task to solve a problem they care about. the fun is only visible when they finish, looking back and realizing: "wow, that was fun!"

recently, an indie game called [tiệm phở của anh hai](https://marisa0704.itch.io/brother-hais-pho-restaurant) went viral without the intention of the creator himself. i guess he just found it fun creating something authentic and very vietnamese—the number of downloads or players probably did not matter that much. similarly, in a [documentary about how python was created](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfH4QL4VqJ0), Guido van Rossum said python started out as a project where he wanted to prove something to himself more than anything. i imagine the process of creating a new programming language is both exciting and tedious at the same time, and the author did not really care about impressing others.

every sort of problem is fun and cool as long as you care about it deeply and personally. virality or adoption is probably just a side effect of that. [the most personal is the most creative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekMl5VHBH4I&t=77s).
