dear friends,

i had this conversation with a friend that i admire and appreciate. we were talking about building projects that are fun and creative. there was a detail where my friend mentioned that she found doing user interviews boring while observing users interacting with the product itself interesting. but i found both interesting AND necessary. we had another conversation where she mentioned another friend of us who stopped doing something because some part of the process was tedious. we had quite a few conversations like that where i realized she had her own definition of "fun", "creative", and "cool" that i do not necessarily agree with.

i realized how easy it is to be influenced by people who you deem are smarter or better than you and adopt their own definitions of something as yours. it's also easy to build things that impress others rather than something that you are genuinely interested in. but sometimes it's hard because you still need to build things that people want in case you're doing a business or startup. regardless of the situations, i'm practicing to form my own opinions and definitions of things. i'm also practicing to not judge other people's interests.
