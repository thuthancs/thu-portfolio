it was just a normal weekend evening. esther and i were making pork ribs because we wanted to try a new vietnamese recipe. as usual, i was amazed by our ability to cook something so simple but make it taste so good. then, out of nowhere, i joked, "what if we did an experiment selling our home-cooked meals? last year i asked a fortune teller and she said i'd get rich if i did something on my own, like a business :)" i didn't expect esther to say yes, but she was genuinely invested. and somehow we decided to execute it the week after.

in less than two days, we brainstormed everything—the food, the packaging, the marketing, how much to prep, when to start cooking. esther was anxiously waiting for the first order (she once tried selling matcha and made zero profit, so she was a little scared this time too). but to our surprise, our first order came from a stranger. not even a friend. as a first-time founder, i consider that a huge win because like what... we're on our way to post-revenue lol.

the next day, i woke up at 3am, took two early-morning classes until 7am, reviewed a coworker's code, then headed to esther's place at 9am. we prepped, cooked, designed a little marketing material, and delivered everything by noon. it was a very packed morning, and i was exhausted, but honestly? i felt fulfilled and rewarded. i always thought i wasn't a good executor, but this whole situation proved i'm way more execution-oriented than i give myself credit for.

when our first customer messaged us saying they loved the dish, it felt magical. like, people actually loved our food as much as we do. and then that evening, we got another order—six boxes—from a small startup. lowkey, i didn't want to accept more orders, but then i thought… why not? take the challenge. so we planned again. and we executed again.

everything happened so fast. i'm still surprised by how well it turned out. we've been jokingly telling ourselves that pursuing a tech career is just what we do for the sake of financial security and deep down, we want to become private chefs because AI (for now) sucks at cooking :) all of this happened while i was job hunting and trying to become a better engineer, and i kept thinking about how everything is so connected in the grand scheme of things.

somewhere along the way, i realized something: everyone—or at least me—should learn to code and build like a chef. someone who iterates relentlessly, executes consistently, and still cares deeply about their craft.
i care a lot about food, especially when i cook for others. and i think the same principle applies to code. you should write it knowing someone else will read it. you should care about how it feels, not just how it works.

i also care a lot about the quality of my code. i treat it like an art form. i don't just want to get it done—i want to get it done beautifully. i want to refine it the same way i improve a dish: gradually, intentionally.

being a chef with strong craftsmanship doesn't mean you're a perfectionist. chefs experiment all the time—how long to marinate, how much to season, which temperature makes the meat just right. that's exactly how i want to approach coding too. care for quality, but don't let that stop execution.

this week we made our first 10 orders (i can finally retire now haha), and i keep thinking, how was that even possible? but looking back, it feels pretty inevitable. when you love your craft and you care about people, you end up building something good.
